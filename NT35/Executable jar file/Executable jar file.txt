How to make executable jar file?
	We can make ".exe" of java files but Java does not provide this feature. We have to take from third-party.
		".exe" file will only run on windows platform but ".jar" is able to run on different OS including MAC, Windows, Linux.
		
		Only GUI application can execute from executable jar file. Console based application can't execute.
		We also have to define that which ".class" has to run first because lot's of ".class" will be inside .jar file.
		For this we have to make ".mf" file and write few commands. ".txt" file also works but the correct way is ".mf" file 
		
					Command: "Main-Class: MyClass after that press enter"
		JVM looks for new line after end of the command so we are giving a new line.
		
		Command to make executable .jar file: 	jar cvmf Make1.jar My.mf *.class
		
		Applying the command: jar cvfm MyPaint.jar MyFile.mf *.* Extra images sid
		
		sub directory does not comes apply *.*  we have to sub directories name explicitly.

													java MyClassName
